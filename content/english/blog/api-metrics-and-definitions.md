## Entry Pages

## Source

See all referral sources that are sending you traffic. A source is reported when a person clicks through to your site from another site.

## Time on Page

The average time people spend on a particular page on your site. This is calculated as the difference between the point when a person lands on a particular page and when they move on to the next page.



## Total Pageviews

The total number of times your pages were loaded by your visitors.


## UTM parameters

To minimize the amount of traffic that falls within the "Direct / None" category, you can add special query parameters (UTMs) to your links. UTMs help you better understand where your traffic is coming from. Vince Analytics supports `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content` and `utm_term`.

## Unique Conversions

When a visitor converts for a particular goal theyâ€™ll be counted as a unique conversion.

## Unique Visitors

The number of people who visited your site. We are privacy-friendly so we don't use cookies and other persistent identifiers. If a person visits from multiple devices or on multiple days, they are counted as separate visitors.

## Views Per Visit (or Pages / Session)

Views per visit (also known as Pages per session) shows the average number of pageviews per visit. Repeated views of a single page are included too.

## Visit Duration

The amount of time visitors spend on your site. It only shows people who visit more than one page. For those who visit one page only we default to 0 seconds. Average visit duration is the sum of all session lengths divided by the number of sessions, which includes the 0 second visits (bounces).


## Total Visits (or Sessions)

A session (also known as a visit) is a set of actions that a user takes on your site. A visit is started when a visitor first lands on your page and ends when no action is taken on your site for 30 minutes.
