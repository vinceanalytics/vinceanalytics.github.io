`vince` is a self hosted web analytics server that is privacy  friendly  with focus on painless deployments..

We created vince because existing solutions didn't cater to our needs, we needed a feature rich, lightweight and easy to manage alternative to google analytics. Solution like Plausible Analytics already exist but they fall short on easy to manage requirement as a result vince was born.

We offer very similar features like Plausible Analytics in  a single binary that is highly optimized for efficiency to ensure you get the most out of your limited budget.

[Geofrey Ernest](https://github.com/gernest) , spent three years researching on how to apply roaring bitmaps index on web analytics events. The reason vince is efficient and fast can be attributed to its compact storage format.
